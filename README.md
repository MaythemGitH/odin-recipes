# Odin Recipes

This is a simple project built as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course. The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML. This will help reinforce core concepts such as:

- Creating structured HTML documents
- Using proper semantic tags (like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.)
- Linking between pages using anchor tags
- Adding images and lists to web pages

Once completed, this project will demonstrate a solid understanding of basic web structure and page navigation.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- HTML boilerplate structure
- Working with text and image elements
- Creating and linking multiple HTML files
- Organizing a simple static website
